## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the Notes App backend on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Make sure the MongoDB server is up and running)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```shell
   cd inotebook-backend
   ```

3. Install the required npm packages:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the Notes App backend, use the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5000` by default. You can change the port in the configuration if needed.

### API Endpoints

The Notes App backend provides the following API endpoints:

- **GET /api/notes**: Fetch all notes.
- **GET /api/notes/:id**: Fetch a specific note by ID.
- **POST /api/notes**: Create a new note.
- **PUT /api/notes/:id**: Update a specific note by ID.
- **DELETE /api/notes/:id**: Delete a specific note by ID.

### Authentication

To secure your API endpoints, consider implementing authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth. You can configure authentication middleware in the `fetchUser.js` file.
